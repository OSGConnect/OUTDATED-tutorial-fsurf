## Overview

[FreeSurfer](http://freesurfer.net/) is software package to analyze the MRI images of human brains. Here, we introdue the `fsurf` workflow that utlizes FreeSurfer.  `fsurf` is a complete pipeline for the brain image analysis on distributed high throughput 
computing platform. The advantages of using  `fsurf` are

     (1) No need to worry about the job scheduler 
     (2) Provides a complete pipeline to analyze the MRI image 
     (3) No need to worry about the data transfers
     (4) Perfom analysis on multiple subjects via distributed high throughput computing

## Tutorial files

It is easiest to start with the `tutorial` command. In the command prompt, type

     $ tutorial FreeSurferWorkflow             # Copies input image file 

This will create a directory `tutorial-fsurf`. Inside the directory you will see the following file:

    test_defaced.mgz              # Input brain MRI file

Here, `test_defaced.mgz` is the brain MRI file. 


## Initial configuration

You need to set up the `fsurf` tool. Run on the command line:

     $ fsurf-config

This command may be placed at the end of your .bashrc file so that it will automatically run when you log in. 

## Process a Scan

A typical image analysis requires doing calculations on multiple-stages via autorecon1, autorecon2, and autorecon3.  All three steps are conveniently handled by `fsurf`. To analyze the MRI file `test_defaced.mgz`

     $ fsurf  --submit --subject test --dir $PWD

In the MRI file `test_defaced.mgz` the prefix `test` is the name of the subject which could be a number or name while the format 
is `mgz` file format. 

### List Workflows

Run the command below to get a list of ids for your workflows that  are running or have already  completed:

    $ fsurf --list 


      Current workflows
      Subject	Workflow         	Submit time      	Cores Used  	Status
      test    	20160104T112401-0600    11:24 01-04-2016 	2           	Running

### Get output from a completed workflow

Run the command below to get the output from a workflow thatâ€™s completed:
 
     $ fsurf --output --id WORKFLOW

Depending on the computer resources available this will typically require several hours to complete.  The output will be saved as an archive in the current working directory: WORKFLOW.tar.bz2 . You can extract all the files in the archive using: 

    $ tar -jxvf WORKFLOW.tar.bz2
  
    $ fsurf --output --id 20160104T112401-0600
    $ tar -jxvf 20160104T112401-0600.tar.bz2

### Remove a running or completed workflow

Run on the command line to remove an existing workflow:
   
    $ fsurf --remove --id WORKFLOW
  
    $ fsurf --remove --id 20160104T112401-0600
    Workflow 20160104T112401-0600 removed successfully
    Waiting for running jobs to be removed...
    Jobs removed, removing workflow directory

This will not effect the files you have fetched with fsurf --output --id WORKFLOW.
